title: "Expanding Objects"
---

Some objects contain references to other related object. For example, a `Feedback` has an associated `Author`. Those objects can be expanded inline with the `expand` request parameter. Fields that can be expanded are noted in this documentation. This parameter is available for certain API requests, and applies to the response of that request only.

You can expand multiple objects at once by identifying multiple items in the expand array.

```bash cURL
curl https://api.latticehq.com/v1/feedbacks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer abc123" \
  -d "expand[]"=author \
  -d "expand[]"=targets \
  -G
```
